## Project Description
This code helps you either choose to encrypt a message or decrypt a message that was encrypted using the same interface/code.

## Rules

- Answer the first question to choose either to encrypt or decrypt a message.
- If you enter a wrong input (encrypt/decrypt) you have only four trials after which you will have to run the code again.
- Type in your message and press 'enter' and the interface will give you either the encrypted message
   or the decrypted message depending on which one you chose.
- The interface will terminate after your message is encrypted/decrypted.
   To encrypt/decrypt another message, you will have to run the code again.

## Workflow
- Researching the topic.
- Tried dictionaries but it got confusing.
- Read about some useful functions in python.
- Used these functions to try to encrypt and decrypt texts.
- Troubleshooting the code till it started working.
- Tried to optimize it and make it a little bit more interactive.
- Tested the code several times to make sure it is working.
- Added introduction and instructions on how to use the code.
- Made the texts a little bit more colorful. 

## Organization
Used Trello to keep track of the tasks done and those that were pending.

Inside the repository there is a folder for the project.
Inside the project folder, there is a jupyter notebook file for the code and also a text file with the whole code.
