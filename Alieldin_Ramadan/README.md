## Project Description
This code helps you either choose to encrypt a message or decrypt a message that was encrypted using the same interface/code.

## Rules
- Answer the first question to choose either to encrypt or decrypt a message.
- If you enter a wrong input (encrypt/decrypt) you have only four trials after which you will have to run the code again.
- Type in your message and press 'enter' and the interface will give you either the encrypted message
   or the decrypted message depending on which one you chose.
- The interface will terminate after your message is encrypted/decrypted.
   To encrypt/decrypt another message, you will have to run the code again.

## Workflow
- First the code displays a welcome message and instructions for the user on how to use the code/interface.
- Then the code prints out a question for the user to ask if the user wants to encrypt or decrypt a message.
- After the user selects which operation he wants to perform, the code then asks the user for the message that they want to encrypt or the code that they want to decrypt.
- As soon as the user input any of the two, the code then displays the output.

## Organization
Used Trello to keep track of the tasks done and those that were pending.

Inside the repository there is a folder for the project called "Alieldin_Ramadan".
Inside "Alieldin_Ramadan" folder, there are two files, the first of is a jupyter notebook file for the code. The second one is a text file with the whole code.
